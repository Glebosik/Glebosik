Hello there, I’m @Glebosik!
I’m interested in mobile and game development.
I’m currently learning Flutter/Dart for mobile and Unity/C# for game development.

Now I'm focused on reworking a project for QR scanning. The present task is to make it smoothly working with Firebase. 
I was working on this project in a team within the Flutter course in the late 2021. Now I want to rework this and get common with Firebase and some other different cool things.
