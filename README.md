# About me

Hello there, I’m @Glebosik!  
I’m interested in mobile and game development.  
I’m currently learning Flutter/Dart for mobile and Unity/C# for game development.

# Current focus

At the moment I'm focused on reworking a project for QR scanning.
I was doing this project in a team within the Flutter course in the late 2021. 
Now I want to rework it and get myself common with Firebase and some other cool stuff.

# Flutter packages

- dio
- flutter_bloc
- hive

- google_ml_kit
- camera
- provider
